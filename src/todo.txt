 - add more parkour stuff, like ladder jumps and maybe neos
 - difficulty levels
 - make the generator more random somehow
 - make database to save scores
 -  highscore stuff
 - make it check height limit as well


DONE:
 - Make it generate two blocks in front of you for faster parkouring
 - detect when the player fails a jump and reset
 - make the world generator which generates void or something (just use void world plugin)
 - set the player's gamemode to adventure ig
 - add a reset animation like blocks breaking with particles on a runnable with a tick delay or something
 - Add reverting blocks and other stuff on shutting down of server
 - scoreboard which shows number of jumps and all that - changed to using action bar
 - check whether the next block is within the slot boundaries
 - start the jump counter system after the parkouring starts
 - make the Slot#getLog() get logs from a hashmap instead of creating a new log
